Setup (Do this before contacting me.)

Step 1:
• Open server.cfg or where you do your Ace Permissions.
• Make sure you have either add_ace group.superadmin "trickOrTreat.admin" allow (YOUR GROUP, IN THIS CASE, I USED superadmin, you may use admin if you wish) OR YOU CAN USE add_ace identifier.steam:YOURSTEAMIDHERE "trickOrTreat.admin" allow

Step 2:
• (OPTIONAL) This is optional. If you decide to use the sounds, make sure you are starting interact-sound before trickOrTreat.
• Make sure that trickOrTreat is ENSURED/STARTED within the server.cfg.

Step 3:
• When ready, make sure you test your item and money-giving before running on a live server.
• Run the command "/startEvent"

OPTIONAL (SOUND SETUP):

Step 1:
• Install and ensure https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-play-custom-sounds-for-interactions/ (interact-sound)

Step 2:
• Move the sound files located in the sound folder of trickOrTreat to interact-sound/client/html/sounds

Step 3:
• Start the event by typing the command "/startEvent", if you hear the witch laugh you've done it correctly. If NOT reach out for help!

Step 4:
• When ready to end the event make sure you do "/endEvent".

ENJOY! Leave a review as well!
