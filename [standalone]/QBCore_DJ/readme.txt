Thanks for downloading the script!
For support and further updates you can join my Discord: https://discord.gg/UyAu2jABzE

Installation:
1.) Put the script in your ressources folder
2.) Import the .sql file to your database.
3.) Set up the Config.lua
4.) Add 'start xsound' and 'start myDj' to your server.cfg

Be sure that you don't rename the ressource. 
Otherwise it will stop working!
